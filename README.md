# OpenGLSGL

## Description
This project is a re-imagined version of the SGL engine made in JS for web browsers that didn't leverage hardware acceleration (GPU) APIs and did all the 3D through software-rendering. The same classes are used but instead we use OpenGL and C++ for a more "realistic" type of engine. 

**Warning: This project is for learning purpose of the OpenGL API and C++ language so it's not a fully optimized engine ready for use.**
